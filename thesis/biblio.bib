    abstract = { A quantal system in an eigenstate, slowly transported round a circuit C by varying parameters R in its Hamiltonian Ĥ(R), will acquire a geometrical phase factor exp{iγ(C)} in addition to the familiar dynamical phase factor. An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor. }

The setup consists of a spin-independent optical lattice that traps a collection of hyperfine states of the same alkaline atom, to which the different degrees of freedom of the field theory to be simulated are then mapped. We show that the combination of bi-chromatic optical lattices with Raman transitions can allow the engineering of a spin-dependent tunneling of the atoms between neighboring lattice sites. These assisted-hopping processes can be employed for the quantum simulation of various interesting models, ranging from non-interacting relativistic fermionic theories to topological insulators. We present a toolbox for the realization of different types of relativistic lattice fermions, which can then be exploited to synthesize a majority of phases in the periodic table of topological insulators.}

Using this point of view a hamiltonian is constructed for electrons for which the ground state is known exactly and whose quasihole excitations have nonabelian statistics; we term these objects “nonabelions”. It is argued that universality classes of fractional quantum Hall systems can be characterized by the quantum numbers and statistics of their excitations. The relation between the order parameter in the fractional quantum Hall effect and the chiral algebra in rational conformal field theory is stressed, and new order parameters for several states are given."

We focus on practical details that are many times overlooked when it comes to implementing the basic building blocks of codes, such as useful data structures to store the tensors, practical ways of manipulating them, and adapting typical functions for symmetric tensors. Here we do not restrict ourselves to any specific tensor network method, but keep always in mind that the implementation should scale well for simulations of higher-dimensional systems using, e.g., Projected Entangled Pair States, where tensors with many indices may show up. To this end, the structural tensors (or intertwiners) that arise in the usual decomposition of SU(2)-symmetric tensors are never explicitly stored throughout the simulation. Instead, we store and manipulate the corresponding fusion trees – an algebraic specification of the symmetry constraints on the tensor – in order to implement basic SU(2)-symmetric tensor operations. This fusion tree approach is readily extensible to anyonic systems, as we demonstrate for a chain of Fibonacci anyons."

	abstract = {This paper provides a study and discussion of earlier as well as novel more efficient schemes for the precise evaluation of finite-temperature response functions of strongly correlated quantum systems in the framework of the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG). The computational costs and bond dimensions as functions of time and temperature are examined for the example of the spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg chain in the critical XY phase and the gapped Néel phase. The matrix product state purifications occurring in the algorithms are in a one-to-one relation with the corresponding matrix product operators. This notational simplification elucidates implications of quasi-locality on the computational costs. Based on the observation that there is considerable freedom in designing efficient tDMRG schemes for the calculation of dynamical correlators at finite temperatures, a new class of optimizable schemes, as recently suggested in Barthel, Schollwöck and Sachdev (2012 arXiv:1212.3570), is explained and analyzed numerically. A specific novel near-optimal scheme that requires no additional optimization reaches maximum times that are typically increased by a factor of 2, when compared against earlier approaches. These increased reachable times make many more physical applications accessible. For each of the described tDMRG schemes, one can devise a corresponding transfer matrix renormalization group variant.}
