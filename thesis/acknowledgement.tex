% Now that I am on the verge of finishing this thesis -- besides being happy that the exhaustive part is finally over -- I feel a great deal of gratitude.
% I would simply not have made it through, were it not for the wonderful people that take part in my life.
% And now the big question to myself is: where do I start?
%
% I want to express my deep gratitude towards Michele B., you are always one of the first persons I approach for professional advice, and I am always blown away from your knowledge.
% It has been an absolute delight to work with you.
%
% Brainstorming with smart and inspiring people is one of the best experiences during my PhD.
% One of the best examples of this ``equivalence class'' is Pietro Massignan.
% I am looking forward to visiting the post-pandemic Primavera Sound festival with you and HÃ©lia.
%
% All my academic collaborators seem to be italian, one of the most delight persons amongst those I met is probably Michele Filippone.
