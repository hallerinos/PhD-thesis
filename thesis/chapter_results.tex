\chapter{Declaration of original contributions}
\label{ch:declaration_of_original_contributions}
I was strongly participated in the publication of five peer-reviewed articles, and I detail my individual contributions in the following.\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{\underline{A. Haller}, M. Rizzi and M. Filippone {\it ``Drude weight increase by orbital and repulsive interactions in fermionic ladders''}, published in Phys. Rev. Research 2, 023058 (2020):
    
    The work was inspired by a discussion between Dr. Michele Filippone and Prof. Matteo Rizzi. The exact solution of the Creutz model was developed jointly by Prof. Rizzi and me. 
    The effective low-energy description of the Creutz model, the perturbation theory and all numerical simulations were performed by me. The initial draft was prepared by me, which was then extended by all authors.}\bigskip
    
    \item{\underline{A. Haller}, M. Rizzi and M. Burrello, {\it ``The resonant state at filling factor $\nu=1/2$ in chiral fermionic ladders''}, published in New J. Phys. 20, 053007 (2018): 
    
    The first observation of effects linked to the resonant state occurred to us while working on a different project during my M. Sc. studies, supervised by Prof. Rizzi. I performed most of the simulations presented in the article during the period of my PhD. Prof. Michele Burrello contributed the second-order RG analysis and prepared the initial draft of the article, which was then extended by all authors.}\bigskip
    
    \item{\underline{A. Haller}, A. S. Matsoukas-Roubeas, Y. Pan, M. Rizzi and M. Burrello, {\it ``Exploring helical phases of matter in bosonic ladders''}, published in Phys. Rev. Research 2, 043433 (2020):
    
    The article resulted from a follow-up study of our work ``The resonant state at filling factor $\nu=1/2$ in chiral fermionic ladders'' by Mr. Apollonas Matsoukas-Roubeas in the scope of his M. Sc. studies supervised by Prof. Burrello. The first version of the RG equations were derived by Mr. Matsoukas-Roubeas and Prof. Burrello. Ms. Yueting Pan aided in the derivation of the low-energy Hamiltonian. The DMRG simulations and the numerical RG solutions were performed by me. The manuscript draft was set up by me, which was then extended by Prof. Burrello and Prof. Rizzi.}
    \newpage
    
    \item{P. Schmoll, \underline{A. Haller}, M. Rizzi and R. Orús, {\it ``Quantum criticality on a chiral ladder: An SU$(2)$ infinite density matrix renormalization group study''}, published in Phys. Rev. B 99, 205121 (2019):
    
    The investigation was initiated by Prof. Román Orús in order to benchmark and test the SU$(2)$ framework developed by my colleague Dr. Philipp Schmoll. Our joint work resulted from regular discussions between Dr. Schmoll and me, during which we developed the exact diagonalization analysis. The SU$(2)$ symmetric MPS simulations were performed by Dr. Schmoll. Part of the numerical results obtained by his SU$(2)$ algorithm were benchmarked against my U$(1)$ symmetric MPS algorithm. The block spin coarse graining was performed by Prof. Rizzi. The mapping to free fermions, which bears a strong connection to ongoing experiments, the development of the effective-low energy Hamiltonian using abelian bosonization and the description of the gapping mechanism was performed by me. Prof. Orús prepared the draft of the manuscript, which was extended by all authors.}\bigskip
    
    \item{\underline{A. Haller}, P. Massignan and M. Rizzi, {\it ``Detecting topology through dynamics in interacting fermionic wires''}, published in Phys. Rev. Research 2, 033200 (2020):
    
    The work resulted from a discussion between Prof. Pietro Massignan and Prof. Rizzi. The numerical simulations and the derivation of the effective spin model was performed by me. The equality between the winding number and the mean chiral displacement was derived by all authors with equal contribution. The blueprint for the experimental realization resulted from discussions between Prof. Monika Aidelsburger and Prof. Massignan. I prepared the initial draft, which was then extended by all authors.}
